# VoodooPad GTD

This is a collection of script plugins for [VoodooPad](http://www.flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/) that I use for my GTD workflow.

## Install
- Copy scripts to `$HOME/Library/Application Support/VoodooPad/Script PlugIns/`
- Restart VoodooPad
- Create "Task List" and "Task Report" pages.
- Read "How to use"


## How to use
- Take notes (in a somehow chaotic way).
- Whenever you find something to be done (i.e: a task) you just add "@todo:" in front of it.
- When you need a task list, you just hit Control + Shift + T and all "@todo:" tags in the current document are listed on a "Task List" page (with a link to the page where the task is)
- When you complete a task, you replace the "@todo:" tag with a "@done:" tag. I use the "Insert Date" script (bound to Control + Shift J) to record the date.
- When you need to check what you've acomplished recently, hit Control + Shift + D, and a "Task Report" page is created with a list of "@done:" tasks.

## TODO
- Build a "Check as Completed" script :)
